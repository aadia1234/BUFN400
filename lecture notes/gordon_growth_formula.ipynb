    "Consider an asset which pays positive **random** cash flows $N$ times per year. For example, stocks often pay dividends quarterly, in which case $N=4$. Call these cash flows **dividends**; others might call them \"net earnings\".  Let $\\Delta t := 1/N$ denote the time interval between cash flow payments. The dividends are $D_0 \\sm \\Delta t$, $D_1 \\sm \\Delta t$, $D_2 \\sm \\Delta t$, ... are paid dates $t_0$, $t_0  + \\Delta t$, $t_0 + 2 \\sm \\Delta t$, ... Note that $D_n$ is the **annualized dividend**, and $D_n / N$ is the dividend actually paid at date $t_n$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating how such assets are valued requires combining estimates of expected returns with estimates of the risk and return of the cash flows.  In general, this is a difficult finance problem for which there are many solutions based on many models. The **Gordon Growth Model** is a simplified way of valuing risk cash flows. Like the concept of yield to maturity, it makes simple assumptions to generate formulas which can be used as approximations to provide intuition for more complicated models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make the following assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The expected return on the risky asset is constant over time, $\\bar{r}$: Investing one dollar after the most recent dividend paid at date $t_n$ yields an expected payoff of $1 + \\bar{r} \\sm \\Delta t$ at date $t_0 + \\Delta t$. Note that the compounding frequency for the expected return $\\bar{r}$ matches the frequency with which dividends are paid. This expected return is generally different from the risk-free rate and varies across stocks. Perhaps \"riskier\" stocks have higher expected returns (or perhaps not---this is an empirically and theoretically controversial issue).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The expected growth rate of dividends is constant across time: $\\mathrm{E}[ D_{n + k} \\; \\vert \\; \\mathcal{H(t_n)} ] = (1 + \\bar{g} / N)^k \\sm D_n$ for $k=1$, $2$, $\\ldots$,.  Here, the notation $\\mathcal{H}(t_n)$ means \"all of the information available to investors at date $t_n$\", including the complete history of dividends up to date $t_n$, $D_0$, $D_1$, $D_2$, $...$ , $D_n$, so that $\\bar{g}$ is the expected growth rate estimated from all information available to investors.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind the other way to think about duration, which defines duration empirically based on how the price would actually change if interest rates increase or decrease.  For example, for a particular stock, its price sensitivity to interest rates might depend on how much debt the company has and on the maturity structure of this debt.  It might also depend on the business cycle sensitivity of the company's cash flows to changes in interest rate policy, for example, based on the sensitivity of the products it sells to interest rates.  For example, if the Fed increases interest rates, the value of a company which builds homes might plunge even if the company had a very large value of $\\bar{r} - \\bar{g}$ and was therefore the opposite of a growth stock (i.e., a **value stock**).  It is not obvious that increases in interest rates have bigger effects on growth stocks than on value stocks.\n",

Different investors can have different values for these parameters in mind.\n",

This growth rate is not necessarily the expected growth rate in the mind of the investor who thinks the risk premium is $\\pi$.  It is a hypothetical growth rate which this investor imputes to the \"the market\".  If the investor disagrees with the market, he would have an incentive to buy the security if his subjective expected growth rate is greater than the market-implied growth rate $\\bar{g}$ or sell the security if his subjective expected growth rate is less than the market-implied growth rate.\n",

    "To deal with the issue that terminal values often appear to be unrealistic and arbitrary results of assumptions about growth rates and discount rates, practitioners often use a **terminal multiple** rather than a terminal growth rate and discount rate. We can define a **trailing** and **forward** terminal multiple as the ratio of the value of the cash flows (e.g., from Gordon's growth formula) to the trailing cash flow $D_3$ or to the future estimated cash flow $(1 + g_\\text{slow} \\sm \\Delta t) \\sm D_3$. The forward multiple version is simply $1 / (r_\\text{slow} - g_\\text{slow})$. Typical multiples might be 8, 10, 12, 15 depending on how fast the cash flows are expected to grow. In practice, multiples are calibrated by using current multiples of comparable companies. Of course, this is problematic since current multiples may not be accurate indicators of future multiples and \"comparable\" companies may not really be comparable. \n",
