    "\n",
    "2. With probability 50 percent, the investment halves in value (1 dollar shrinks to 0.50 dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the expected gross return is $0.50 * 2.00 + 0.50 * 0.50 = 1.25$, so one dollar is expected to grow to 1.25 dollars. The expected net return is $0.50 * 2.00 + 0.50 * 0.50 - 1.00 = 0.25 = 25 \\text{ percent}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the expected net return is 25 percent, the \"effective median\" return is 0 percent since doubling and halving converts one dollar into one dollar. More precisely, if the investment is held for an even number of time periods, the median return is exactly 0 percent.\n",

    "If an investor holds this investment for many periods, approximately half of the sample paths will have an internal rate of return less than zero and approximately half of the sample paths wil have an internal rate of return greater than zero. This occurs because there will more good periods than bad periods about half the time, and vice versa.  There is also the borderline case where the number of good outcomes is exactly the same as the number of bad outcomes.  This is the theoretical median outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Some people say, \"Due to the way in which venture capitalists invest, most of the returns from a venture capital fund come from a few good investments.\" This statement is a simple consequence of the properties of geometric Brownian motion. Venture capital investments have very high variance, sometimes approximately 100 percent per year. Returns also have a shape not too different from a lognormal.  Therefore the statement is simply a property of the high variance of the approximately lognormal investment.  It depends on nothing else which is specific to venture capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Some people say, \"Hedge funds offer risky returns, but most of them underperform their benchmark over time. Therefore, hedge funds are bad investments.\" This statement may be incorrect or misleading in several respects. First, most hedge funds have relatively low volatilities of 10-15 percent per year. Second, if hedge funds did have high volatility and returns approximated geometric Brownian motion, then most hedge funds would underperform over time (by half their variance, i.e., 50 basis points per year for a hedge fund with 10 percent annual volatility), even if the hedge funds did match or exceed their benchmarks on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some people say, \"Long term internal rate of return is a good statistic for estimating long-term mean returns\".  This statement is false because the long-term IRR measures the mean of the log returns, not mean returns.  It is lower than the actual mean by half the variance if returns follow geometric Brownian motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Some people say, \"If a portfolio has good mean returns and you invest with more leverage (e.g., 60 percent, 100 percent, 200 percent, exposure to the asset), then your investment will have better performance in the long run.\"  This statement is false.  We will explain why next.\n"

At the end of each period, the investor holds a fraction greater than $x$ in the risky asset if its return was greater than the risk-free asset and holds a fraction less than $x$ is its return was less than the risk-free asset.  Therefore, to maintain the target fraction $x$, the investor needs to engage in a dynamic trading strategy of selling the risky asset when its price rises and buying the risky asset when its price falls. This strategy is **stabilizing** in the sense that its price impact goes against market movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If $x > 1$, the investor borrows at the risk-free rate to invest more than 100 percent of wealth in the risky asset. We can think of the borrowing as taking place in a margin account. Now the investor still needs to rebalance the portfolio over time, but the rebalancing strategy becomes destabilizing.  At the end of each period, the investor holds a fraction less than $x$ in the risky asset if its return was greater than the risk-free asset and holds a fraction more than $x$ is its return was less than the risk-free asset.  Therefore, to maintain the target fraction $x$, the investor needs to engage in a dynamic trading strategy of buying the risky asset when its price rises and selling the risky asset when its price falls.

Now the investor still needs to rebalance the portfolio over time, but the rebalancing strategy remains destabilizing, like the leveraged long investor with $x > 1$.  Therefore, to maintain the target fraction $x$, the investor needs to engage in a dynamic trading strategy of buying the risky asset when its price rises and selling the risky asset when its price falls. This strategy is **destabilizing** in the sense that its price impact amplifies market movement.\n",
